all the web pages containing the words of the query\", \"Due to the massive size of the Web  the number of hits islikely to be much too large to be handled by the user\", \"Therefore  some measure of quality is needed to filter away pages that are likely to be less interesting\", \"When one uses a web search engine it is typical that the search phrase is underspecified\", \"Example\", \"A Google

number ofweb pages relevant to the search phrase was more than  billions\", \"Obviously Google uses an algorithm for ranking all the web pages that agreesrather well with a commonsense quality

inlinks from other pages that have a high rank\", \"We will see that this selfreferencingstatement can be formulated mathematically as an eigenvalue equation for a certain matrix\", \"Pagerank It is of course impossible to define a generally valid measure of relevance that wouldbe acceptable for a majority of users of a search engine\", \"Google uses the conceptof pagerank as a quality measure of
